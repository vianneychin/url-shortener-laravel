## 🧩 Database Choice

> I used mySQL for the database as that was the best choice to use alongside Laravel.

## 🧪 Unit Tests

> I was able to create a very basic Unit Test to check if the page was rendering properly. Laravel has unit tests out of the box which is awesome!

## 🚶‍♀️ Approach

> I used PHP/Laravel and mySQL. I was very surprised how all the functions are utility functions and work behind the scenes in Laravel. I feel like the longer I use it, the more out of the box functions I'll be able to remember.

## 🌵 Other

> It is my first time using Laravel and PHP and it would be a pleasure to use it more and more. Getting the development setup took at least 4+ hours because mySQL wasn't allowing me to migrate with artisan which lead me to constantly uninstalling and reinstalling mySQL with Homebrew and an immense amount of Googling. I eventually had to download it from Oracle.
